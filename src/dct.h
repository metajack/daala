/*These are approximations of a true type-II DCT that can be computed entirely
   with integer operations.
  The integerization is done with lifting steps to allow them to be perfectly
   reversible using only small precision outputs.
  If no quantization is performed, the inputs can be recovered exactly.
  This is in contrast to most linear, perfect reconstruction transforms, such
   as a true DCT, which might easily have two implementations which return
   different answers, due to the limited precision of their calculations.
  The drawback, of course, is that these transforms are not truly linear, since
   they use rounding and truncation.

  The 4-point and 16-point transforms are scaled to match the orthonormal
   version of the DCT (where the L^2 norm of each basis function is 1).
  The 8-point transform requires a scale factor of sqrt(0.5) to be applied
   to match the orthonormal version.

  The inverse version of this transform does not come close to passing the
   IEEE1180-1990 conformance test for an iDCT, with peak errors as large as 11
   in the 8x8 case.
  However, that test uses evenly distributed random inputs.
  For natural images, samples are much more correlated, and a common model is
   an AR(0) process with a correlation coefficient of 0.95.
  For this model, the mean squared error is very small, less then 2E-5 in the
   8x8 case.

  The 4-point transform adds one bit of dynamic range to the outputs (e.g.,
   inputs in the range [-256,255) will produce outputs in the range [-512,511).
  The 8-point and 16-point transforms both add 2 bits of dynamic range (e.g.,
   inputs in the range [-256,255) will produce outputs in the range
   [-1024,1023).*/
